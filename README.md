## Getting Started

To run these labs on your local machine, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hi-skittles/python1212.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the specific lab directory:

    ```bash
    cd python1212/
    ```

3. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python lab_XX.py
    ```

## Additional Notes

- Most labs do not import any external libraries, aside from some system libs such as `typing` and `os`. This was intentional, as the labs were meant to be completed using only the Python Standard Library. Any imported libraries were imported after the fact post assignment turn in.
